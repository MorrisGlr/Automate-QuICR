    "Patient": "Sol Lopez, 71-year-old female",
    "Key Highlights for Medical Decision-Making (MDM) Improvement": "\n- Risk stratification: Calculate CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc and HAS-BLED scores to guide anticoagulation and bleeding risk assessment.\n- Diagnostic evaluation: Obtain ECG confirmation of atrial fibrillation, baseline labs (CBC, BMP including renal function, LFTs, TSH), and transthoracic echocardiogram to assess for structural heart disease and exclude valvular AF.\n- Rate vs rhythm control: Discuss rate\u2010control strategy given asymptomatic presentation and narrow options for rhythm control in this age group.\n- Anticoagulation discussion: Review DOAC versus warfarin, dosing adjustments based on renal function, cost, monitoring requirements, and patient preferences.\n- Hypertension management: Confirm elevated readings with ambulatory or home BP monitoring and initiate appropriate pharmacotherapy (thiazide or ACE inhibitor) plus lifestyle modifications.\n- Medication reconciliation: Document over\u2010the\u2010counter NSAID use (naproxen) and counsel on bleeding risk when combined with anticoagulation.\n- Patient education: Ensure documented discussion of risks/benefits of anticoagulation, recognition of bleeding signs, and importance of medication adherence.\n- Follow\u2010up planning: Establish timeline for lab rechecks, blood pressure monitoring, and specialist referrals if indicated.",
    "Chief Concern": "Newly diagnosed asymptomatic atrial fibrillation; seeking guidance on appropriate medications.",
    "Assessment": "Sol Lopez is a 71-year-old female with Apple Watch\u2013detected asymptomatic atrial fibrillation and untreated hypertension. Vital signs confirm irregularly irregular rhythm and BP 146/82. She has no history of heart failure, stroke, diabetes, or bleeding. CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc score is 3 (age 65\u201374 = 1; female = 1; hypertension = 1), indicating anticoagulation. Differential diagnosis: 1) Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 2) Secondary hyperthyroidism (pending TSH), 3) White-coat hypertension or labile BP.",

            "Status": "Newly diagnosed, asymptomatic, not yet anticoagulated or rate\u2010controlled",
            "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "- Obtain 12-lead ECG to confirm AF.\n- Order CBC, BMP (with CrCl), LFTs, TSH to identify reversible causes and guide medication dosing.\n- Schedule transthoracic echocardiogram to assess left atrial size, LV function, and exclude valvular disease.\n- Calculate CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc and HAS-BLED scores.",
            "Treatment/Medication Plan": "- Anticoagulation: Start apixaban 5 mg PO twice daily (adjust to 2.5 mg BID if CrCl <25 mL/min or age \u226580 years plus weight \u226460 kg; monitor renal function at baseline and annually).\n- Rate control: Initiate metoprolol tartrate 25 mg PO twice daily, titrate to resting HR <80 bpm. Alternative: diltiazem 120 mg ER daily if beta\u2010blocker intolerant.\n- Counsel to avoid NSAIDs (naproxen) while on anticoagulation.",
            "Contingency Planning": "- If resting HR remains >100 bpm after 2 weeks, increase metoprolol to 50 mg BID or switch to diltiazem.\n- If significant bleeding (eg, hematuria, melena), hold apixaban, obtain CBC and fecal occult blood, and reassess anticoagulation strategy.\n- If echo shows LVEF <40%, refer to cardiology for consideration of rhythm control or specialized therapy.",
            "Considerations for Documentation Improvement": "- Document patient\u2019s understanding of stroke vs bleeding risk, and discussion of DOAC vs warfarin.\n- Record baseline AF burden (episodes, duration) and symptomatic status in detail.\n- Note patient\u2019s preference and social factors affecting adherence.",
            "Considerations for Cost Effective Care Improvement": "- Consider warfarin if patient has financial barriers to DOAC; ensure INR monitoring capacity.\n- Use generic metoprolol for rate control.\n- Bundle lab orders to avoid repeated phlebotomy visits."

            "Treatment/Medication Plan": "- Initiate chlorthalidone 12.5 mg PO daily in the morning. Alternative: lisinopril 10 mg PO daily if ACE inhibitor preferred.\n- Advise DASH diet, sodium <2.3 g/day, regular aerobic exercise (30 minutes most days).",
            "Contingency Planning": "- If BP >140/90 after 4 weeks, increase chlorthalidone to 25 mg daily or add ACE inhibitor.\n- If orthostatic hypotension develops, decrease dose or switch classes.",
            "Considerations for Documentation Improvement": "- Include multiple BP readings, timing, and measurement technique.\n- Note lifestyle counseling specifics and patient\u2019s willingness to change.",
