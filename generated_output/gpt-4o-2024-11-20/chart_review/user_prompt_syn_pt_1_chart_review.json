  "Patient Name": "Not provided",
  "Key Highlights for Medical Decision-Making (MDM) Improvement": "- Confirm the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with appropriate diagnostic tests, such as an ECG or Holter monitor.\n- Evaluate the patient's risk factors for stroke using the CHA2DS2-VASc score to guide anticoagulation therapy.\n- Assess and manage the patient's hypertension to reduce cardiovascular risks.",
  "Assessment": "This is a 71-year-old female presenting for evaluation and management of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, identified via wearable technology. She is asymptomatic and has a history of untreated hypertension. Her physical examination reveals an irregularly irregular pulse consistent with atrial fibrillation.",
  "Plan": {
    "Problem 1": {
      "Problem Name": "Atrial Fibrillation",
      "Status": "Newly diagnosed, asymptomatic.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Order an ECG to confirm the diagnosis and consider a Holter monitor for further rhythm evaluation.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Initiate anticoagulation therapy based on CHA2DS2-VASc score assessment. Discuss rate versus rhythm control strategies and consider starting a beta-blocker for rate control.",
      "Contingency Planning": "Advise the patient to seek immediate care if symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurological deficits occur."
    },
    "Problem 2": {
      "Problem Name": "Hypertension",
      "Status": "Previously diagnosed, untreated.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Measure blood pressure over multiple visits or consider ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to confirm the diagnosis.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Initiate antihypertensive therapy, such as a thiazide diuretic or ACE inhibitor, and provide lifestyle modification counseling.",
      "Contingency Planning": "Monitor blood pressure response to therapy and adjust medications as needed."
    },
    "Problem 3": {
      "Problem Name": "Preventative Care",
      "Status": "Due for comprehensive evaluation.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Order baseline laboratory tests including CBC, CMP, lipid panel, and TSH. Schedule age-appropriate cancer screenings.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Administer influenza and pneumococcal vaccines if not up-to-date.",
      "Contingency Planning": "Follow up on test results and address any abnormalities."
    },
    "Problem 4": {
      "Problem Name": "Health Maintenance",
      "Status": "Requires update.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Review and update immunization status.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Provide counseling on diet, exercise, and smoking cessation (if applicable).",
      "Contingency Planning": "Reassess during follow-up visits."
    },
    "Anticipatory Preventative Care": {
      "Item 1": "Encourage regular physical activity tailored to the patient's abilities.",
      "Item 2": "Discuss dietary modifications to support cardiovascular health.",
      "Item 3": "Provide education on recognizing symptoms of stroke and when to seek emergency care.",
      "Item 4": "Schedule follow-up in 4 weeks to assess treatment response and adherence."
