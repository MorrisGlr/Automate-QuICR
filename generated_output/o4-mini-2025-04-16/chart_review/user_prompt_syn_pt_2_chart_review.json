  "Patient": "Phil Wiser, 62\u2011year\u2011old male",
  "Key Highlights for Medical Decision\u2011Making (MDM) Improvement": "\u2022 Incomplete medication reconciliation: no documentation of over\u2011the\u2011counter or herbal supplements, adherence assessment, or home glucose logs.  \n\u2022 Lack of standardized depression screening despite self\u2011reported stress and lifestyle barriers.  \n\u2022 Absence of comprehensive immunization review and health maintenance planning.  \n\u2022 Limited risk stratification for ASCVD and CKD progression\u2014no formal calculation of 10\u2011year risk or staging discussion beyond eGFR.  \n\u2022 Opportunity to optimize glycemic control by adding evidence\u2011based agents (SGLT\u20112i/GLP\u20111 RA) given CKD and high A1c.  \n\u2022 Underaddressed lifestyle interventions: no structured referral to dietician or exercise program.  \n\u2022 Preventive screenings (retinopathy, foot exam, colon cancer) not documented as scheduled or completed.  \n\u2022 Missing follow\u2011up intervals and contingency triggers (e.g., if A1c >8% after 3\u00a0months).  \n\u2022 Cost\u2011containment: no discussion of generic statin selection, low\u2011cost behavioral supports, or prior authorization needs for newer antidiabetic agents.",
  "Chief Concern": "Refill of metformin for type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus management.",
  "Assessment": "62\u2011year\u2011old male with established type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 2\u00a0years ago, presenting for refill of metformin ER 500\u00a0mg BID.  Despite maximal tolerated metformin dose, A1c is 9.8% and he admits to poor adherence (out of meds 6\u00a0months), no home glucose monitoring, unbalanced diet, no exercise, and significant psychosocial stress from divorce.  Vital signs notable for BMI 38\u00a0kg/m2, BP 130/79. Exam unremarkable; feet exam and monofilament testing normal.  Labs: eGFR 55\u00a0mL/min (CKD 3a), urine ACR 50\u00a0mg/g (moderately increased albuminuria), LDL\u00a0137\u00a0mg/dL.  Differential: 1) uncontrolled type\u00a02 DM; 2) obesity\u2011related insulin resistance; 3) early diabetic kidney disease with albuminuria.",

    "Problem\u00a01": {
      "Problem Name": "Type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled",
      "Status": "Not at goal (A1c 9.8%) despite metformin ER 2000\u00a0mg daily",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Reviewed A1c, eGFR, albuminuria; referred for retinopathy screening.  Will obtain baseline and 3\u2011month follow\u2011up labs (A1c, CMP, lipids, urine ACR).  Assess for hypoglycemia and GI tolerance.",
      "Treatment/Medication Plan": "\u2022 Continue metformin ER 500\u00a0mg BID (generic)  \n\u2022 Initiate empagliflozin 10\u00a0mg daily (renal protection, cardioprotection) given eGFR 55  \n\u2022 Advise structured SMBG twice daily initially, then PRN.  \n\u2022 Lifestyle: referral to dietician, prescribe 150\u00a0min/week moderate exercise.",
      "Contingency Planning": "If A1c remains >8% at 3\u00a0months, consider adding dulaglutide 0.75\u00a0mg weekly.  If eGFR falls <45, discontinue empagliflozin.  If GI side effects, reduce metformin to 500\u00a0mg BID and retitrate.",
      "Considerations for Documentation Improvement": "Document patient\u2019s adherence history, home glucose values, SMBG teaching and logs, tolerance of metformin, and shared decision\u2011making regarding new agents.",
      "Considerations for Cost Effective Care Improvement": "Use generic metformin, empagliflozin available as generic soon\u2014check formulary.  Utilize manufacturer savings cards for SGLT\u20112i.  Leverage free diabetes education programs."

      "Contingency Planning": "If no weight loss \u22655% at 3\u00a0months, discuss pharmacotherapy (orlistat) or weight loss referral.  If bariatric surgery criteria met and lifestyle fails, refer to surgery evaluation.",
      "Considerations for Documentation Improvement": "Include detailed nutritional assessment, weekly exercise logs, and weight change trajectory.",
      "Considerations for Cost Effective Care Improvement": "Promote free community exercise classes, online healthy eating resources; avoid expensive weight loss drugs unless criteria met."
