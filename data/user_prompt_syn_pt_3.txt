reason for visit: "to check my health"

## Subjective
### History of Present Illness
Patient recently immigrated from London to live with her daughter. She reports being generally healthy but has not seen a doctor in several years and does not have her previous medical records. She recalls being told she had "high blood pressure" in the past but was never on medication. She is unsure about any history of high cholesterol or diabetes. She has a fear of needles and has always declined blood work and immunizations, with the exception of tetanus shot that she got after stepping on a rusty nail 3 years ago. 

She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant fatigue but does report occasional headaches. 

She's had a "normal" pap smear 4 years ago. She doesn't remember the date of her last mammogram and reports that it was unremarkable. She admits to smoking cigarettes for over 25 years with an average of 1 pack per day due to her stressful job as a lawyer. She struggles with motivation and reports feeling lonely since moving to the US as she left behind friends and colleagues.
