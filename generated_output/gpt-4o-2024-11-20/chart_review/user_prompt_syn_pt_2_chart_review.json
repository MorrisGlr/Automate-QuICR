  "Patient Name": "Phil Wiser",
  "Key Highlights for Medical Decision-Making (MDM) Improvement": "- Ensure comprehensive documentation of the patient's medical history, including family and surgical history, to provide a complete clinical picture.\n- Address the patient's lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, with specific, actionable recommendations.\n- Emphasize the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring and adherence to prescribed medications.",
  "Chief Concern": "Refill for metformin for diabetes management.",
  "Assessment": "Mr. Phil Wiser, a 62-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed two years ago, presents for re-establishing care and medication refill. He has been non-adherent to his diabetes management plan, including medication and lifestyle modifications, due to personal stressors. His last recorded HbA1c was 9.8%, indicating suboptimal glycemic control. He denies symptoms of hyperglycemia or complications such as neuropathy or retinopathy. Physical examination and recent labs suggest no acute complications but highlight the need for improved diabetes management.",
  "Plan": {
    "Problem 1": {
      "Problem Name": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",
      "Status": "Suboptimally controlled, with HbA1c of 9.8%.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Order baseline labs including HbA1c, lipid panel, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio to assess current status and potential complications.",
      "Treatment/Medication Plan": "Restart metformin ER at 500 mg twice daily, titrating to the maximum tolerated dose. Provide dietary counseling and recommend a structured exercise program.",
      "Contingency Planning": "If HbA1c remains above target in three months, consider adding a second-line agent such as a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor.",
      "Considerations for Documentation Improvement": "Document the patient's understanding and agreement with the treatment plan.",
      "Considerations for Cost Effective Care Improvement": "Discuss generic medication options and community resources for diabetes education."
    },
    "Anticipatory Preventative Care": {
      "Item 1": "Schedule a diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "Item 2": "Recommend annual comprehensive foot exams.",
      "Item 3": "Update immunizations, including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.",
      "Item 4": "Provide smoking cessation resources if applicable.",
      "Item 5": "Encourage regular dental check-ups to prevent periodontal disease.",
      "Item 6": "Discuss weight management strategies to reduce BMI.",
      "Considerations for Documentation Improvement": "Ensure all preventative care recommendations are clearly documented with patient consent and understanding noted."
    },
    "Follow Up Care": {
      "Item 1": "Reassess HbA1c and fasting glucose levels in three months.",
      "Item 2": "Monitor for side effects or intolerance to metformin.",
      "Item 3": "Evaluate adherence to lifestyle modifications.",
      "Item 4": "Review results of retinopathy screening.",
      "Item 5": "Reassess lipid profile and renal function in six months.",
      "Item 6": "Provide ongoing support for stress management and coping strategies.",
      "Considerations for Documentation Improvement": "Document patient-reported outcomes and adherence to follow-up recommendations."
