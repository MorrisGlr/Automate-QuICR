  "Patient": "Bill Moore, 75-year-old male",
  "Key Highlights for Medical Decision-Making (MDM) Improvement": "- Inconsistent documentation across two notes on same visit date: conflicting statements regarding prior labs, eye exams, kidney disease history. Establish a single, reconciled HPI.\n- Lack of documented home blood glucose monitoring data; encourage patient to record readings to guide therapy titration.\n- No explicit rationale documented for choice of semaglutide over other second-line agents (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors) given kidney disease and cost considerations.\n- Preventive care gaps not addressed in early MDM: immunizations, foot and eye exam scheduling, social determinants of health impacting adherence.\n- No documentation of blood pressure or microalbuminuria targets, or plan for ACE inhibitor/ARB to slow CKD progression.\n- Medication reconciliation incomplete: metformin dosing history unclear, timing of last dose, reason for extended-release formulation.\n- Contingency planning limited: no if-then statements for side effects, hypoglycemia, or lack of A1c response.",
  "Chief Concern": "Lab follow-up for type 2 diabetes management and refill of metformin",
  "Assessment": "Bill Moore is a 75-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed in 2023, presenting for lab review and medication refill. He reports no new symptoms but admits to six months without metformin, poor diet, no exercise, and significant psychosocial stress. Objective data: A1c 9.8%, creatinine 1.6 mg/dL (eGFR 55 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2), microalbuminuria (50 mg/g), LDL 137 mg/dL, BMI ~36.5, BP 132/84. He has stage 3a CKD and microvascular risk. Likely diagnosis: inadequate glycemic control due to non-adherence and suboptimal regimen. Differential: 1) Persistent hyperglycemia from non-adherence vs inadequate regimen; 2) CKD progression secondary to diabetes; 3) dyslipidemia driving cardiovascular risk.",

      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Reviewed labs showing A1c 9.8%. No home glucose data; patient to obtain glucometer and record fasting and post-prandial readings for 2 weeks. Consider CGM if adherence issues persist.",
      "Treatment/Medication Plan": "\u2022 Metformin ER 500 mg: increase from no current dose to 500 mg BID first week, then 1000 mg BID as tolerated (max 2000 mg daily).  \n\u2022 Semaglutide subcutaneous: start 0.25 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then increase to 0.5 mg weekly; titrate to 1.0 mg based on tolerance and glycemic response.  \n\u2022 Alternatives: empagliflozin 10 mg daily if injectable intolerance or cost barrier (renal benefit, weight loss).",
      "Contingency Planning": "\u2022 If nausea or vomiting with semaglutide: hold dose, resume at prior tolerated dose; consider switching to dulaglutide.  \n\u2022 If A1c remains >8% at 3 months: add basal insulin (glargine) with start 10 units nightly and titrate.",
      "Considerations for Documentation Improvement": "Document baseline home glucose values and regimen adherence history; specify titration schedule and patient education on injection technique.",
      "Considerations for Cost Effective Care Improvement": "Assess patient\u2019s prescription coverage before semaglutide; consider SGLT2 inhibitor or sulfonylurea (glipizide) if cost prohibitive, with counseling on hypoglycemia risk."
