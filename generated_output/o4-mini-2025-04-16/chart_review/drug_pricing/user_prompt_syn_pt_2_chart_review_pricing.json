    "Key Highlights for Medical Decision-Making (MDM) Improvement": "- Clearly document baseline and interval lab values and dates to track trends (e.g., prior A1c, lipids, renal function).\n- Include patient\u2019s last eye and foot exam dates (or note \u201cnever\u201d and reason) to justify referrals.\n- Expand HPI to capture psychosocial factors in structured form (e.g., PHQ-9 for depression, stress assessment).\n- Specify fasting status for lipid panel and A1c orders to avoid confusion.\n- Document medication reconciliation: prior metformin regimen, adherence issues, and rationale for re-titration schedule.\n- Note eGFR staging and link to metformin dosing decisions.\n- Include risk stratification (ASCVD risk calculator) to guide lipid management.",
    "Chief Concern": "Prescription refill for metformin",
    "Assessment": "62-year-old man with established type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 2 years ago, presenting for medication refill and diabetes management. He has been off metformin for >6 months due to personal stressors, and has not performed home glucose monitoring or attended routine diabetic screenings. Objective data show a BMI of 37.9 (obesity), HbA1c 9.8% (poor glycemic control), LDL 137 mg/dL (elevated), eGFR 55 mL/min/1.73m2 (CKD stage 3a), and microalbuminuria (ACR 50 mg/g). He denies polyuria, polydipsia, neuropathy symptoms, and has normal foot exam. He reports an unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, and no immunizations on record. Differential: 1) Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus; 2) Obesity-related insulin resistance; 3) Early diabetic kidney disease.",

            "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Re-established baseline labs today (CMP, CBC, A1c, lipids, urine ACR) to characterize glycemic control, renal function, dyslipidemia. Referred for annual diabetic retinopathy screening. Foot exam performed today; normal. Plan home SMBG: fasting and post-prandial checks 2x/day.",
            "Treatment/Medication Plan": "Restart metformin ER 500 mg twice daily (total 1000 mg daily), increase in 500 mg increments weekly to 2000 mg daily as tolerated. Counsel on GI side effects and advise taking with evening meal. Discussed long-term add-on therapy if A1c remains >8.0% at 3 months (e.g., GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i based on CKD).",
            "Contingency Planning": "If GI intolerance occurs \u2192 reduce to 500 mg daily for 1 week then reattempt titration. If A1c remains >8.5% at 3-month follow-up \u2192 add empagliflozin 10 mg daily (renal benefit). If eGFR falls <45 \u2192 hold metformin per guidelines and adjust regimen.",
            "Considerations for Documentation Improvement": "Include pre-visit home glucose logs and ensure explicit mention of prior regimen/dosing. Document rationale for titration schedule and metformin safety in CKD.",
            "Considerations for Cost Effective Care Improvement": "Metformin is first-line, generic, cost-effective. Delay expensive add-ons until confirming adherence and titration. Use in-house diabetes educator resources rather than outpatient nutritionist referral when possible."
