  "Patient Name": "Phil Wiser",
  "Key Highlights for Medical Decision-Making (MDM) Improvement": "- Ensure regular follow-up visits to monitor diabetes management and address any emerging complications.\n- Encourage patient adherence to prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications.\n- Establish a comprehensive care plan including regular screenings and preventive measures.",
  "Assessment": "Phil Wiser, a 62-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed two years ago, presents for re-establishment of care and medication refill. He reports suboptimal diabetes management due to personal stressors, with no recent monitoring or preventive screenings. Physical examination and laboratory findings indicate poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c 9.8%) and early signs of nephropathy (eGFR 55 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2, albumin/creatinine ratio 50 mg/g creat).",
  "Plan": {
    "Problem 1": {
      "Problem Name": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",
      "Status": "Poorly controlled, with elevated HbA1c and early nephropathy.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Order baseline labs including HbA1c, lipid panel, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio to assess current status.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Refill metformin ER 500 mg, titrate to maximum tolerated dose, and initiate lifestyle counseling focusing on diet and exercise.",
      "Contingency Planning": "If HbA1c remains elevated, consider adding a second-line agent such as an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist."
    },
    "Problem 2": {
      "Problem Name": "Diabetic Retinopathy Screening",
      "Status": "Not previously performed.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Refer to ophthalmology for a comprehensive eye exam.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Ensure patient schedules and attends the appointment.",
      "Contingency Planning": "If retinopathy is detected, collaborate with ophthalmology for management."
    },
    "Problem 3": {
      "Problem Name": "Diabetic Nephropathy",
      "Status": "Early signs present.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Monitor renal function and albuminuria regularly.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Optimize blood pressure and glycemic control to slow progression.",
      "Contingency Planning": "If renal function declines, consider nephrology referral."
    },
    "Problem 4": {
      "Problem Name": "Preventive Care",
      "Status": "Immunizations and screenings not up-to-date.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Review immunization history and administer indicated vaccines.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Provide influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines as appropriate.",
      "Contingency Planning": "Ensure follow-up to complete vaccine series."
    },
    "Anticipatory Preventative Care": {
      "Item 1": "Encourage smoking cessation if applicable.",
      "Item 2": "Promote regular physical activity tailored to patient's abilities.",
      "Item 3": "Discuss stress management techniques to improve overall health.",
