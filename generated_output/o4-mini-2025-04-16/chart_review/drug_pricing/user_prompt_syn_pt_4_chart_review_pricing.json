    "Key Highlights for Medical Decision-Making (MDM) Improvement": "- Incomplete assessment of medication adherence and social factors at first visit; deeper HPI in second visit revealed non\u2010adherence due to divorce stress.  Suggest standardized adherence screens and psychosocial assessment templates.\n- Documentation inconsistently captures immunization history, waist circumference, and home SMBG practices.  Recommend structured fields for vaccines, diet/exercise, and self\u2010monitoring.\n- Lab interpretation is accurate (A1c\u00a09.8%, eGFR\u00a055) but lacks linkage to CKD staging and metformin dosing thresholds.  Document CKD stage and metformin adjustments if eGFR\u00a0<45 mL/min/1.73\u00a0m\u00b2.\n- Intensification of diabetes therapy with semaglutide is appropriate given poor control and preserved renal function.  Consider upfront statin initiation for primary prevention in diabetes with LDL\u00a0137\u00a0mg/dL; document ASCVD risk calculation.\n- Preventive care referrals (retinopathy screening) are ordered, but timing and tracking of results are not documented.  Use a referral\u2013results tracking tool.\n- Cost-effective glycemic control alternatives (e.g., dulaglutide patient assistance programs, generic metformin titration) should be documented as part of shared decision-making.\n- Contingency planning for GLP\u20111 agonist side effects, hypoglycemia management, and non\u2010response is not explicitly documented.  Incorporate \u201cif\u2013then\u201d treatment adjustment pathways.",

    "Assessment": "Bill Moore is a 75-year-old man with a two-year history of type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled (A1c\u00a09.8%), stage\u00a03a CKD (eGFR\u00a055\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m\u00b2), obesity (BMI\u00a036.7\u00a0kg/m\u00b2), and newly recognized hyperlipidemia (LDL\u00a0137\u00a0mg/dL).  He has significant psychosocial stressors (divorce) leading to medication non\u2010adherence and unhealthy diet/exercise behaviors.  No evidence of microvascular complications on exam; scheduled ophthalmology appointment pending.  Differential diagnosis: 1) uncontrolled type\u00a02 DM due to non\u2010adherence and suboptimal regimen, 2) secondary poor glycemic control from psychosocial stress, 3) early diabetic kidney involvement without overt albuminuria (UACR\u00a050\u00a0mg/g).",
