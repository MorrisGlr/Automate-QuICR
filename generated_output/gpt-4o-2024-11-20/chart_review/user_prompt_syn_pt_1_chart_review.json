  "Patient Name": "Sol Lopez",
  "Key Highlights for Medical Decision-Making (MDM) Improvement": "- Ensure comprehensive diagnostic workup for atrial fibrillation to identify underlying causes and risk factors.- Initiate appropriate anticoagulation therapy based on CHA2DS2-VASc score.- Address hypertension management to reduce cardiovascular risk.",
  "Assessment": "Sol Lopez is a 71-year-old female presenting with a recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation detected via wearable technology. She is asymptomatic and has no significant past medical history or risk factors for thromboembolism. Her blood pressure is elevated, and her pulse is irregularly irregular, consistent with atrial fibrillation.",
  "Plan": {
    "Problem 1": {
      "Problem Name": "Atrial Fibrillation",
      "Status": "Newly diagnosed, asymptomatic.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Order an ECG to confirm atrial fibrillation and assess for any structural heart abnormalities. Consider echocardiography for further evaluation.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Initiate anticoagulation therapy based on CHA2DS2-VASc score to reduce stroke risk. Discuss options including direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).",
      "Contingency Planning": "If symptoms develop or persist, consider referral to cardiology for rhythm management."
    },
    "Problem 2": {
      "Problem Name": "Hypertension",
      "Status": "Elevated blood pressure noted during visit.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Confirm diagnosis with home blood pressure monitoring or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Initiate lifestyle modifications including dietary changes, physical activity, and sodium restriction. Consider starting antihypertensive medication.",
      "Contingency Planning": "Reassess blood pressure control in follow-up; adjust treatment as needed."
    },
    "Problem 3": {
      "Problem Name": "Preventative Care",
      "Status": "Patient has not had recent medical evaluations.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Order baseline laboratory tests including CBC, CMP, lipid panel, and TSH.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Schedule age-appropriate cancer screenings and vaccinations.",
      "Contingency Planning": "Address any abnormal findings in follow-up visits."
    },
    "Problem 4": {
      "Problem Name": "Health Maintenance",
      "Status": "No recent medical history available.",
      "Decision Making and Diagnositic Plan": "Review and update immunization status.",
      "Treatment Plan": "Provide education on healthy lifestyle choices and regular medical follow-ups.",
      "Contingency Planning": "Monitor adherence to health maintenance recommendations."
    },
    "Anticipatory Preventative Care": {
      "Item 1": "Schedule mammogram and colonoscopy as per guidelines.",
      "Item 2": "Administer influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.",
      "Item 3": "Discuss bone density testing for osteoporosis screening.",
      "Item 4": "Provide counseling on fall prevention and home safety."
