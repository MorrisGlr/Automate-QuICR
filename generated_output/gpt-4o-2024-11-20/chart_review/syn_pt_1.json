    "Assessment": "71-year-old female with recently diagnosed asymptomatic atrial fibrillation, first noted on an Apple Watch notification two weeks ago. No history of diabetes, stroke, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, or bleeding risk factors. Not currently taking antihypertensive or anticoagulant medications. Blood pressure elevated at 146/82 mmHg, and pulse noted to be irregularly irregular at 88 bpm. The primary concerns are stroke prevention and rate versus rhythm control strategies.",
    "Plan": {
        "Atrial Fibrillation": {
            "Status": "Newly diagnosed, asymptomatic, and likely persistent atrial fibrillation without prior medical evaluation.",
            "Decision Making and Diagnostic Plan": "Obtain an ECG to confirm atrial fibrillation and consider an echocardiogram to assess structural heart disease and left atrial size. Order TSH to rule out secondary causes. Assess thromboembolic risk using the CHA2DS2-VASc score and bleeding risk using the HAS-BLED score.",
            "Treatment Plan": "Initiate anticoagulation with apixaban or rivaroxaban for stroke prevention based on CHA2DS2-VASc score. Consider starting rate control therapy (e.g., metoprolol or diltiazem) if tachycardia is noted. Discuss options for rhythm control if indicated after further workup.",
            "Contingency Planning": "If symptoms develop (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath), arrange for urgent evaluation. If anticoagulation is contraindicated or concerns arise, consider cardiology referral for alternative options such as left atrial appendage closure."
        },
        "Hypertension": {
            "Status": "Elevated blood pressure (146/82 mmHg) without current treatment.",
            "Decision Making and Diagnostic Plan": "Confirm diagnosis with home blood pressure monitoring or ambulatory blood pressure measurement. Assess for end-organ damage (renal function, electrolytes, and ECG for LVH).",
            "Treatment Plan": "Initiate lifestyle modifications (low-sodium diet, increased physical activity). Consider starting lisinopril or amlodipine if repeat blood pressure readings remain elevated.",
            "Contingency Planning": "If blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite initial intervention, adjust medication regimen or consider secondary hypertension evaluation."
        },
        "Anticipatory Preventative Care": {
            "Cardiovascular Risk Reduction": "Counsel on diet (DASH diet), exercise, and smoking avoidance. Discuss aspirin therapy if indicated based on ASCVD risk.",
            "Bone Health": "Recommend baseline DEXA scan given age-related osteoporosis risk.",
            "Cancer Screening": "Discuss mammogram and colorectal cancer screening options based on guidelines and patient preference.",
            "Vaccination": "Administer influenza, pneumococcal, and shingles vaccines if not up to date."
