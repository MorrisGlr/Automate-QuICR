  "Patient Name": "Bill Moore",
  "Key Highlights for Medical Decision-Making (MDM) Improvement": "- Ensure consistent follow-up on lab results and medication adherence.- Address lifestyle modifications with specific, achievable goals.- Monitor renal function closely due to elevated creatinine levels.",
  "Chief Concern": "Lab follow-up and diabetes management.",
  "Assessment": "Mr. Bill Moore, a 75-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, presents for lab follow-up. His recent labs indicate suboptimal glycemic control (HbA1c 9.8%) and reduced renal function (eGFR 55 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2). He reports no acute symptoms but acknowledges challenges in managing his health due to personal stressors. The patient is currently on metformin and has been prescribed semaglutide to improve glycemic control.",
