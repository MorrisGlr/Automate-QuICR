    "Assessment": "71-year-old female with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) identified via Apple Watch notification. The patient has no symptoms and no known history of heart failure, stroke, or other major comorbidities. Blood pressure is elevated (146/82 mmHg), but the patient is not on any antihypertensive medications. Her irregularly irregular pulse and lack of symptoms suggest paroxysmal or early-onset AF. No other significant findings from her medical or family history were reported, and she has not had recent healthcare evaluations.",

        "Atrial Fibrillation": {
            "Status": "Newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation without symptoms.",
            "Decision Making and Diagnostic Plan": "Given the patient's asymptomatic presentation, an echocardiogram to assess for structural heart disease and left atrial thrombus is recommended. Anticoagulation therapy should be considered, particularly in light of her elevated blood pressure and risk of stroke. Cardiology referral for further management of AF and to discuss rate or rhythm control options is indicated. Blood pressure management will be initiated to reduce stroke risk.",
            "Treatment Plan": "Initiate anticoagulation with either apixaban or rivaroxaban based on renal function and patient preference. Start a calcium channel blocker (e.g., diltiazem) for rate control due to the absence of symptoms. Blood pressure should be managed with an ACE inhibitor (e.g., lisinopril) or calcium channel blocker (e.g., amlodipine). Advise monitoring of INR or anti-Xa levels depending on anticoagulation choice.",
            "Contingency Planning": "If the patient experiences symptoms like palpitations, dizziness, or chest pain, consider referral to the emergency department for further evaluation. If symptoms develop that suggest worsening of atrial fibrillation or a clot, repeat diagnostic imaging (e.g., CT or TEE) may be required."

        "Hypertension": {
            "Status": "Uncontrolled hypertension with a BP reading of 146/82 mmHg.",
            "Decision Making and Diagnostic Plan": "Confirm if the elevated blood pressure is consistent across multiple readings, and assess for end-organ damage. Begin antihypertensive therapy with either an ACE inhibitor or calcium channel blocker. The patient should also monitor blood pressure at home.",
            "Treatment Plan": "Initiate antihypertensive therapy, starting with an ACE inhibitor such as lisinopril or a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine. Counsel on lifestyle modifications such as reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, and weight loss. Follow-up in 1 month for blood pressure re-evaluation.",
            "Contingency Planning": "If blood pressure remains poorly controlled, consider increasing the dose or adding a thiazide diuretic or ARB. Recheck electrolytes and renal function after initiating therapy."

        "Preventative Care": {
            "Vaccinations": "Recommend annual influenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination (if not already received). Discuss shingles vaccination if not yet completed.",
            "Cancer Screening": "Ensure the patient has had regular screening for breast cancer (mammography) and colorectal cancer (colonoscopy), appropriate for her age. If no recent screenings, consider scheduling these.",
            "Bone Health": "Discuss osteoporosis screening with DEXA if not previously done, given her age."
