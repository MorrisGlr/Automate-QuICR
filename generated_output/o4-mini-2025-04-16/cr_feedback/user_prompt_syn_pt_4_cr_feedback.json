  "Feedback Summary": "The chart review provides a largely comprehensive assessment and a structured, multi\u2011problem plan that integrates decision making, treatment strategies, and contingency planning.  The assessment succinctly summarizes Bill Moore\u2019s diabetes, CKD, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and psychosocial stressors, and the plan outlines appropriate pharmacologic and non\u2011pharmacologic interventions.  Opportunities exist to strengthen the assessment by explicitly defining goals, staging CKD, and quantifying cardiovascular risk, and to refine each problem plan with SMART targets, clearer timelines, assignment of responsibilities, and more granular preventive and follow\u2011up details.",

    "Overall Recommendations": "1. Incorporate SMART goals (quantitative targets and deadlines) for each problem to measure progress.  \n2. Explicitly state CKD stage, cardiovascular risk score, and guideline\u2011based targets in the assessment.  \n3. Use structured templates or health maintenance flow sheets to capture immunizations, screenings, and referral tracking.  \n4. Delegate tasks and assign team roles with specified deadlines (e.g., schedule UACR recheck, administer vaccines).  \n5. Enhance patient education plans by detailing who delivers instruction, when, and how progress will be documented.  \n6. Leverage EMR tools (tickler systems, reminders) to ensure timely follow\u2011up on labs, referrals, and behavioral health visits."
